   - Dynamic lighting effects

2. **The Time Spiral**
   - 500 cubes forming a colorful spiral
   - Represents cyclical nature of time
   - Smooth camera movements

3. **Eisenhower Priority Matrix**
   - 4 quadrants visualization (Urgent/Important matrix)
   - Animated task cubes bouncing within quadrants
   - Color-coded priorities:
     - Red: Urgent & Important
     - Green: Not Urgent & Important
     - Orange: Urgent & Not Important
     - Blue: Not Urgent & Not Important

4. **Pomodoro Technique**
   - 3D tomato timer with glowing effects
   - 25-minute segment visualization
   - Orbiting particles representing focus cycles
   - Pulsing animation

5. **Time Flow Visualization**
   - 1000+ particles flowing through space
   - Color-shifting based on position
   - Represents the continuous flow of time
